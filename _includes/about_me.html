          I am a software engineer in the Catalog space of the Merchandising department at The Home Depot with a 
          <a href="https://www.credential.net/coxzk5me?key=acd89490bdfe162f06b1b39aac3ba74f67c8a244e5ab638e3d52cd23116071f3">Professional Data Engineer Certification</a>. 
          So far during my time there I have been a part of three separate teams that have each had their 
          own unique challenges dealing with product data either in Google Cloud or in our on premise data centers. 
        <p>
          I have an inquisitive mind and am naturally drawn to taking on challenging problems. 
          I obtained my Bachelor of Science Degree with a double major in Applied Mathematics and 
          Computer Science from Emory University in the fall of 2017, where I received a full 
          tuition scholarship. Previously I worked at SFL Scientific as a Data Science Consulting 
          intern and The University of Cambridge as a VICHF-IREU fellow.

          Before starting my job at Home Depot, I was unfamilliar with how software was built 
          at scale, but as my knowledge of the software development lifecyle increased, my interests 
          in operational work dealing with ensuring the scalability and reliability of distributed systems 
          has grown. I have enjoyed designing, building, and operationalizing data processing systems and 
          am open to data engineering positions that allow me to further develop those skills in addition 
          to allowing me to deploy machine learning models to production.

          <li>
            Developed secure, reliable, and scalable RESTful microservices using Spring Boot on Google's Compute Engine that support our clients with a 95th percentile latency of 9ms with a 100% uptime.
          </li>
          <li>
            Built TeamCity CI/CD piplines that facilitate test automation, static code analysis, containerization, archiving, and deployment to various lifecycles.

          <li>
            Classified faces based on how wrinkly they are for L’Oréal using transfer learning with an Inception V3 age classification model resulting in a testing accuracy of 85%.
          </li>
          <li>
            Led a group project involving the implementation of user and item based collaborative filtering algorithms (testing RMSE of 0.97 and 0.92 respectively) for the purpose of
