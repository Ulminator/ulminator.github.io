			    My personal interests include:
        	</p>
			  <ul>
					<li>
						<b>Machine Learning Infrastructure.</b> 
						Just as enterprises have built out infrastructure that enables engineers to requisition resources for regular applications, 
						there is now an ever growing need for infrastructure that unifies data processing, model training, and deployment for machine 
						learning models across users with varying skillsets with regards to engineering and statistics.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Service Mesh</b>. 
						With Kubernetes winning the container orchestration wars, there is now a growing desire for stronger management 
						over microservices with the use of a service mesh architecture that facilitates service discovery, traffic management, 
						observability with dirstributed tracing, and the abstracting of code dealing with security away from the applciation layer. 
						Currently I am learning Golang to help contribute to an internal project at work related service mesh.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Computer Networks</b>. 
						Since my time working in the <a href="https://simbiosyslab.github.io/">Simbiosys lab at Emory</a> I have been interested in advances 
						in technology that make it feasible to provide cheap, universal internet to developing countries.

						Utilized ZeroMQ's DEALER-ROUTER pattern with Node's cluster module and MongoDB to implement an API that ingests transaction data, classifies <a href="https://github.com/Ulminator/recurring-transactions">recurring transactions</a>, and informs users for the purposes of saving money.
